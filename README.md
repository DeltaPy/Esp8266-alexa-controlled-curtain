# ESP8266 Alexa controlled curtain

This is a project to control a curtain with an ESP8266 through Alexa using the FauxmoESP library and two buttons.
The curtain is driven by a servo connected to a H-bridge motor driver [L293D].

If someone is interested in the wiring diagram or other info, just let me know.
